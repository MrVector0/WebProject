            <h2>Who was he?</h2>
            <p class = "paragraph-one" >
            Leonhard Euler was a Swiss mathematician whose work laid the foundation for many branches of modern mathematics. He introduced clear and efficient mathematical notation, including symbols and methods still used today. His contributions span calculus, graph theory, mechanics, and number theory, helping simplify complex problems and organise mathematical thinking. Euler’s ability to connect abstract theory with practical application made his work essential to the development of science and engineering.

            <h2>What did he do?</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-two">
                Euler’s work produced some of the most recognised results in mathematics, including the complex exponential identity that unifies trigonometry and analysis and forms the backbone of signal processing, electrical engineering, and quantum mechanics. He introduced the constant now known as Euler’s number, which defines natural logarithmic growth and appears in calculus, compound interest, probability theory, and differential equations. His polyhedron formula connected vertices, edges, and faces in a relationship that became the starting point for topology and modern geometric reasoning. These discoveries reinforced the structure of mathematical notation, strengthened analytical methods, and established tools still used in modelling oscillations, waves, circuits, stability, and transformation systems across engineering and applied sciences.
